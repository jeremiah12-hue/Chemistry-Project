                    <span id="a_message">Hey friend, <br /> 
                        You are welcome to "learn chemistry with ease". This is an 
                        educational platform where you are granted the opportunity to learn and understand chemistry 
                        with ease, even as a dummie, a newbie or even a total newbie to the concept of chemistry, you 
                        are welcome. You will also be able to relate chemistry to real life and your daily activities
                        as we learn, you will also agree with me that there is nothing on earth that is not chemistry.
                        STAY PUT AND KEEP READING... <br />
                        We made a video tutorial for easy understanding of this concept, link below<br />
                       <strong>THANKS...!</strong>

                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT DOES CHEMISTRY REALLY MEAN?</h1>

                    <p>Do you ever wonder how did life on earth originate? Or how does an organism reproduce, grow and age? What is the essence of life and disease?</p>

                    <p>These thoughts all have chemical answers. Pretty mind-blowing right?</p>

                    <p>The impact of chemistry on your personal, everyday life is mind blogging.</p>

                    <p>How about considering what the beginning of a typical day might look like from a chemical point of view.</p>

                    <p>Molecules conform in the liquid crystal display of your clock and electrons flow to create a noise.</p>

                    <p>A flow of neuronal activators wakes your brain, and you throw off a thermal insulator of manufactured polymer and jump in the shower to emulsify fatty 
                        substances on your skin and hair with purified water and produced detergents or soaps.
                    </p>

                    <p>Then, you decorate yourself with some processed chemical pleasant-smelling colored materials suspended in cosmetics gels, dyed polymeric fibers, 
                        synthetic footwear’s, and metal-alloyed jewelry.
                    </p>

                    <p>Breakfast is a bowl of nutrient-enriched, spoilage-hindered cereal and milk, a piece of fertilizer-grown, pesticide treated fruits, and a cup of a hot 
                        aqueous solution of refreshing alkaloid.
                    </p>

                    <p>After rubbing your teeth with artificially flavored dental-hardening agents in a colloidal mixture, you are now ready to go out there and make the best 
                        out of the day, so you grab your phone and laptop (an electronic device containing ultrathin, micro etched semiconductor layer powered by a series of voltaic cells), 
                        collect your books (processed cellulose and plastic, electronically printed with light and oxygen resistant inks), hop into your hydrocarbon-fueled metal-vinyl-ceramic 
                        vehicle, electrically ignite a conformable series of controlled gaseous explosions, and you’re off to class!
                    </p>

                    <p>The influence of chemistry extends to our natural environment as well.</p>

                    <p>The air, water, land and the organisms that thrive there form a remarkably complex system of chemical interactions.</p>

                    <p>While modern chemical products has enhanced the quality of our lives, their manufacture and use also pose increasing dangers on us, such as toxic wastes, acid rain, 
                        global warming and ozone layer depletion.
                    </p>

                    <p>If our careless disregard of chemical principles has led to some of these problems, our careful adherence to the same principles is helping to solve them.</p>

                    <p>Though, the significance of chemistry is most profound when we look at the chemical nature of biology.</p>

                    <p>Molecular events taking place within you right now allow your eyes to scan this page and your brain cells to translate fluxes of electric charge into thoughts.</p>

                    <p>The science of chemistry deals with the makeup of the entire physical universe. Chemistry is the study of matter and its properties, the changes matter undergoes, 
                        and the energy associated with these changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>As you learn and understand what chemistry really means and its ideas, your mind’s eye will learn to see a hidden level of the universe, one filled with incredibly 
                        minute particles moving at fantastic speeds, colliding billions of times a second, and interacting in ways that determine how all the matters inside and outside of you behave.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you wish to know more about the discovery and significance of chemistry, do well to follow up our next lectures and uploads.</p>
