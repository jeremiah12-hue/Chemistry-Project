                    <span id="a_message">Hey friend, <br /> 
                        You are welcome to "learn chemistry with ease". This is an 
                        educational platform where you are granted the opportunity to learn and understand chemistry 
                        with ease, even as a dummie, a newbie or even a total newbie to the concept of chemistry, you 
                        are welcome. You will also be able to relate chemistry to real life and your daily activities
                        as we learn, you will also agree with me that there is nothing on earth that is not chemistry.
                        STAY PUT AND KEEP READING... <br />
                        We made a video tutorial for easy understanding of this concept, link below<br />
                       <strong>THANKS...!</strong>

                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS CHEMISTRY?</h1>

                    <p>Do you ever wonder why our fire woods burns to ashes when we light them up?</p>

                    <p>Or why after the simmering (boiling) process of a cup of rice, the grains becomes fluffy?</p>

                    <p>What about ever asking yourself the question of why is it that water kept in the refrigerator get iced (solid) after a while?</p>

                    <p>Or how can putting just some kind of gas in a cylinder makes the gas cooker that I just used in cooking my delicious meal?</p>

                    <p>You know it’s funny though, that’s why we used to believe that chemistry is a rocket science, and it’s hard to comprehend.</p>

                    <p>No, chemistry is neither hard nor a rocket science and I will tell you why in this blink, just let’s proceed with your cup of coffee or tea.</p>

                    <p>For you to learn and understand chemistry with ease, you need a good understanding on matter.</p>

                    <p>Yes, your question is what then is matter?</p>

                    <p>Let’s delve; matter is anything that has mass and occupies space like our basic chemistry lectures teaches us, yes it’s accurate.</p>

                    <p>In reality the food we eat is matter because it has weight and occupies space, so does your books, pens, clothes, shoes, 
                        and even yourself and the phone, tablet, or laptop computer you are using to read this document now.</p>

                    <p>But there is something even more interesting about these matter, concentrate your attention, 
                        when I bring out a sheet of paper and start dividing it into two equal halves, 
                        I then throw away one half and divide the other half into two equal parts, on repeating this process, 
                        you would agree with me that there would come a time that I cannot repeat the process again, 
                        and that’s because the new half would be so small that I can barely hold them with my fingers to start dividing.</p>

                    <p>Okay, let’s now say I start repeating this process using a razor blade, 
                        you would also agree with me that a time would come when the new half would now be very small that I can barely hold and see them, 
                        that is called an ATOM.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the concept of atom, molecules and ions comprehends what matter really is all about.</p>

                    <p>We are delving into the concept of atom, molecules and ions in subsequent blinks, so follow us, like and subscribe to get notified.</p>

                    <p>So how then can I define chemistry?</p>

                    <p>Chemistry is defined as a science that is concerned with the composition and the structure, interaction of matter, 
                        and also the forces that hold the structures together.</p>

                    <p>Getting to understand this concept, you will find out that there is nothing on earth that is not chemistry.</p>

                    <p>Just like on burning of our fire woods, since our fire woods are made up of fibre (cellulose) and minerals.</p>

                    <p>On lighting up these fire woods, oxygen gas and other component of air (mainly carbon, hydrogen) would react with our burning fire woods 
                        to form carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, while the minerals turn into ashes.</p>

                    <p>That is chemistry, it’s a chemical change.</p>

                    <p>Also on simmering (boiling) of rice, two processes take place; 
                        the absorption and the evaporation processes.</p>

                    <p>First off, the rice absorbs water that helps cook the starch in each rice grain, also for expansion and softness.</p>

                    <p>On boiling, the heat causes the water on the rice to evaporate in the form of steam, 
                        which changes the physical state of the rice from solid state to a fluffy state.</p>

                    <p>That is also chemistry, it is a physical change.</p>

                    <p>From these two examples you observe the physical and chemical 
                        which will be discussed in latter lectures on changes of matter.</p>

                    <p>You can make your research on the other chemical processes brought up as questions in the introduction section.</p>
